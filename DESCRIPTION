Description: Conduct simulations of the Response Adaptive Block Randomization (RABR) design to evaluate its type I error rate, power and operating characteristics for binary and continuous endpoints. For more details of the proposed method, please refer to Zhan et al. (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.9104>.
